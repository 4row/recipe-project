                    <li>
                      Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread each sheet of puff pastry onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll pastry into even rectangles. Lift pastry (with parchment paper) onto baking sheets
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                      Pierce puff pastry all over with a fork. Beat egg with water in a small dish; brush pastry all over with egg wash.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                      Beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in banana and vanilla extract on low speed until thoroughly combined; mix in flour mixture just until dough comes together. Using lightly floured hands, press dough firmly and evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                      Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. 
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                      Meanwhile, pulse tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon of the olive oil, garlic, and a pinch of salt together in a food processor until pureed..
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                      Bake until cheese is melted and crust edges are golden, about 5 minutes more. Remove from the oven and scatter basil leaves over the top. Slice and serve hot
